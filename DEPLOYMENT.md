npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
cd fertivision-cloud-production
vercel --prod

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
```

### Manual Static Hosting
```bash
# Build static files
npm run build
npm run export

# Upload .next/out/ folder to any static hosting:
# - AWS S3 + CloudFront
# - GitHub Pages
# - Firebase Hosting
# - Any CDN provider
```

## üîê Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Clerk Authentication Setup
1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Update allowed origins to include your production domain
3. Configure redirect URLs:
   - Sign-in: `https://yourdomain.com/sign-in`
   - Sign-up: `https://yourdomain.com/sign-up`
   - After sign-in: `https://yourdomain.com/dashboard`

### 2. Admin Access Verification
1. Sign in with admin email: `satish@skids.health`
2. Verify admin dashboard access: `/admin/dashboard`
3. Test API billing management: `/admin/api-billing`
4. Confirm all admin features are working

### 3. API Testing
Test all endpoints in production:

```bash
# Basic health check
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/usage

# Test with authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer test_key" \
     https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/subscription
```

### 4. Payment Integration
1. Update Razorpay configuration for production
2. Test QR code generation

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Performance Monitoring
- **Netlify Analytics**: Built-in traffic and performance metrics
- **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor loading performance
- **API Response Times**: Track clinical API performance
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor 4xx/5xx responses

### Business Metrics
- **User Registrations**: Track sign-ups via Clerk dashboard
- **API Usage**: Monitor via `/admin/api-billing`
- **Revenue Tracking**: Built-in billing analytics
- **Customer Growth**: Track subscription upgrades

### Health Checks
Set up monitoring for:
- Site uptime (99.9% target)
- API endpoint availability
- Authentication service status
- Database connectivity (when implemented)

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

### Automatic Deployment
Netlify automatically deploys when you push to the main branch:

```bash
# Any push to main branch triggers deployment
git push origin main
```

### Branch Previews
- **Feature branches**: Automatic preview deployments
- **Pull requests**: Preview links for testing
- **Staging environment**: Use `develop` branch for staging

### Rollback Strategy
- **Instant rollback**: Use Netlify dashboard to rollback to previous deployment
- **Git-based rollback**: Revert commits and push to trigger new deployment
- **Feature flags**: Implement feature toggles for safe releases

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
# Common fixes:
npm install  # Update dependencies
npm run type-check  # Fix TypeScript errors
npm run lint  # Fix linting issues
```

#### Authentication Issues
```bash
# Verify environment variables are set
# Check Clerk dashboard for correct URLs
# Ensure API keys are not exposed in client code
```

#### API Errors
```bash
# Check function logs in Netlify
# Verify CORS configuration
# Test API endpoints locally first
```
